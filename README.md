**üî• Project description**<br/>
Cryptalk is a secure text and voice chat application that allows for real-time communication for teams, build specifically for the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology for their faculty and student base. The project requires scalable cloud infrastructure to manage the backend database and large number of requests, and a sleek and enjoyable user interface

**‚òÑÔ∏è Features**<br/>
User authentication
User profile & customisation
Friend request system
Direct messaging
Channel system
Text channels & Voice channels
Specific channel permission system
Attachment sending and downloads (all stored on-cloud)
WebRTC, Peer to peer voice chat

**‚ùÑÔ∏è Outstanding Problems**
1. ~~Socket server overhaul, problems with TLS/SSL certificates on production app. Voice chat only works with local development server running at the moment.~~
2. ~~Sockets and WebRTC can be optimised further to reduce connection dropouts.~~
3. Video chat can easily be implemented with the above changes, but for now is too buggy to keep in the production app.
4. ~~Edit channel button bug, bugs screen to be blurred~~

**üåµ Problems Fixed**
1. Socket server has been created, running as a https Node.js server using a valid certificate.
2. Socket server code optimised to ensure connections are dropped when the socket client stops responding
3. Edit channel button now only shows for the channel owner
4. Self hosted peer server created, uses same HTTPS server as the socket.io server at '/peer'

**‚ôü Technology**
1. React.js Frontend
2. GraphQL for realtime data queries
3. DynamoDB
4. AWS Cognito for authentication and user management
5. Socket.io & PeerJs for WebRTC voice & video chat
6. Cypress End-to-end testing
